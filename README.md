# Leo Thunder Datapack
This is a very simple Minecraft datapack that'll add a campfire to toggle a never-ending thunderstorm.

## Installation
+ Normal datapack steps, copy the contents of this project into the datapacks folder of your world.
+ Once loaded, navigate to the location you want to add the campfire
+ Run the command `/function leothunderpack:summon_shrine` and a campfire will be placed at your feet.

## Uninstalling
+ Run the function `/function leothunderpack:destroy_shrine` to remove the placed shrine
+ Remove the datapack from the datapacks folder.


## Using the shrine
If the regular campfire is doused, it will change into a soul campfire and a thunderstorm will start.
This storm will not end until the soul campfire is doused again.

Regular spawning thunderstorms have no impact on this campfire.


## Can I use this?
Yep, but it's just for plaiyng around so I can learn how to datapack. You should checkout the code in the data folder to see
what this actually does, and I don't promise it's perfect or safe (although I'm running it on my own server).
